# hello-world
This is me following a tutorial

My name is Madison Perry and I am 20 years old at the time of writing this. I have a dog and a cat and a mom and a dad all of whom I love dearly. I am teaching myself github and R over the summer, because I hope to become an economist and these seem like very useful skills.
